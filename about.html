<p> The Teemulis are an organization that programs, tinkers, builds and does much more. The organization is primarily for experimentation and for its members. Of course, others are allowed to use their programs and other things and work even if it does not serve their purpose. The organization was founded in 2025 by Onyx and is still managed and maintained by him as owner. </p>
